Reflection Paper: Making My Web Portfolio (HTML, CSS, JS)

Making my web portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was really a challenge for me. I’m not really good at front-end development, so this task was not easy. I had to force myself to learn and do it, even though I mostly relied on AI tools instead of hard coding everything.

At first, it was fun and exciting. I enjoyed seeing the small progress I made. But later on, it became frustrating. I had ideas I wanted to add, but I didn’t know how to make them work. I also struggled with background design and choosing colors, especially when no one was giving suggestions. I realized that design is not my strength, and I prefer simple and clean looks. I don’t like websites with too many decorations or effects.

Even though my portfolio looks very simple, I think it still shows a part of who I am. Maybe 30% of my personality can be seen through it. I tried my best to finish it, even if I was not confident in this area. This experience taught me that it's okay to struggle, and it’s okay to use tools that can help.

Thank you, Sir, for giving us this task. I may not be a front-end developer, but I’m proud that I was able to create something.
